To solve this, implement robust type checking and data validation during data retrieval.  Use the appropriate type guards or validation functions in your code to ensure consistency. Consider converting values to the correct type before using them in calculations or comparisons.

```javascript
//Example of robust type checking and handling
const snapshot = await ref.get();
const data = snapshot.val();

const count = typeof data.count === 'number' ? data.count : parseInt(data.count, 10);

if (isNaN(count)) {
  console.error('Count cannot be parsed as a number!');
  //Handle the parsing error, perhaps use default value.
  count = 0;
}

//Now use 'count' which is guaranteed to be a number
```

This approach ensures that your application doesn't crash due to type mismatches and handles potential errors gracefully.
