The issue stems from an inconsistent handling of data types within Firebase's Realtime Database. Specifically, when retrieving data, the types might not always match the expected types in your application code.  For example, you might expect a numerical value but receive a string, leading to unexpected behavior or crashes. This often happens when data is initially entered inconsistently or migrated from an older system.

```javascript
//Example of inconsistent data leading to errors
const snapshot = await ref.get();
const data = snapshot.val();

if (typeof data.count === 'string') {
  console.error('Count is a string, expected a number!');
  //Handle the type mismatch
}
```
